# ElectionIQ

  Per a study done by the United States Census Bureau, only 60% of people were registered to vote in 2014, and only 40% ended up visiting the polling booth. Because voting is such an integral part of the American way, we began wondering why so many people end up not doing their civic duty. After asking ourselves and some friends for an answer to this question, we found the reason abundantly clear: we don't know enough about elections to confidently cast our ballot. Seeing as this election is getting tight, we here at KU Team #1 decided to create ElectionIQ, an online web service that offers information pertaining to elections, allowing users to confidently exercise their right to vote.

  ElectionIQ solves this problem by providing the user with custom-tailored information specific to their location. Through a streamlined interface, users simply input their address, and our program delivers a wealth of information, including nearby polling locations, registration sites, and local and national candidates. Our website also offers information in regards to becoming a registered voter.

  What we are trying to do with ElectionIQ is encourage American citizens to vote by giving them the information they need to make responsible decisions for the country and their futures. We anticipate that this website will increase the number of registered voters, as well as increase the amount of people voting on election day. With ElectionIQ, American voters can confidently cast their ballots with the knowledge that they are making the best choices for their future.
